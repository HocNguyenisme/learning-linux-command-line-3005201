🛠️ Log Inspector & Security Scan Tool (log_inspector.sh)
Project Overview

log_inspector.sh is a lightweight but powerful Bash-based security and log-processing tool designed for Linux system administrators, cybersecurity students, and DevOps engineers. The script inspects log files, scans for suspicious activity, highlights warnings and errors, and summarizes key findings.

This project demonstrates real-world Linux skills using grep, sed, awk, cut, wc, sort, and pipelines—fundamental tools used in professional system monitoring and automation.

🔑 Key Features
✔️ Security Scanning

Detects suspicious patterns (e.g., unauthorized modifications, specific keywords, or injected code markers).

✔️ Log Summaries

Counts occurrences of key alert words (ERROR, FAIL, WARNING, etc.) and displays summaries.

✔️ Highlighting

Color-coded terminal output for better visibility (if supported).

✔️ Extracts Key Fields

Pulls timestamps, usernames, or event types from logs to accelerate analysis.

✔️ Non-Destructive

Never modifies the original log file—always safe.

🔍 Case Study: The Problem & The Solution
The Problem

System logs grow quickly and manually reviewing them becomes nearly impossible—especially during security events. During training labs, we discovered:

Some files were world-writable (777), creating security risks.

Others contained suspicious injected code, such as:

[UNAUTHORIZED_MODIFICATION_ALERT_X9]


Searching the file system manually wasted time.

The Solution

The log_inspector.sh script was designed to:

Automatically search all log and text files under /tmp or a specified directory.

Identify security issues, such as:

Suspicious code markers

World-writable files

Produce clean, human-readable summaries to speed up triage and reporting.

Provide a one-command assessment, similar to real security tools.

This reduces a multi-minute manual task to under 3 seconds.

⚙️ Usage
1. Make the script executable
chmod +x log_inspector.sh

2. Run the script
./log_inspector.sh system.log


You may also scan directories:

./log_inspector.sh /tmp

🧠 Example Features in the Script (you can add these if missing)
Retrieve suspicious code:
grep -R "[UNAUTHORIZED_MODIFICATION_ALERT_X9]" "$TARGET"

Find world-writable files:
find "$TARGET" -type f -perm 777

Count warnings:
grep -i "warning" "$TARGET" | wc -l

Show timestamps:
cut -d' ' -f1,2 "$TARGET"

🧩 How It Works

The script chains together multiple Linux text-processing tools:

Tool	Purpose
grep	Find patterns, warnings, failures
sed	Clean or normalize text lines
awk	Extract structured data
cut	Extract fixed-position fields
find	Scan directories for files
sort + uniq	Summaries & deduplication
wc	Counting events

These are combined using pipelines (|) to produce fast, accurate analysis output.

🔒 Security Best Practices Included

Never alters user files—only reads.

Detects misconfigured permissions (777).

Highlights possible security breaches.

Encourages proper triage instead of modifying or deleting user data.
